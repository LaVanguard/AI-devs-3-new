# AI devs 3
My private attempts to solve AI devs 3 training tasks.
All private API keys and passwords are stored in secrets.py file (in the format shown in public example-secrets.py file).
For now it includes the following:
- lib/aidevs.py - simple library to interface with the AI devs official system (for sending answers - and whatever else shows up in the future)
- prework.py - simple solution to the "prework" task (get 2 strings from a remote file and submit them as list)
